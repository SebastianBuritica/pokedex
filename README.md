# NEXTJS POKEDEX

This project was created using nextJs to learn and master the react framework with serverside rendering, the styles were applied using tailwind.css,
in this project we used the pokeapi to learn the methods of fetching data with static props, in this projects different core react concepts were applied such as props,
exports, however no hooks were used here also I would like to mention practices of next used such as Link routing. 


## About 

Next.js is a framework that makes it easy to create 'universal' React apps - React apps that do both client and server side rendering.

With Next.js, React pages are automatically rendered on both client and server side, without the hassle of setting up dependancies like webpack or babel and with automatic routing and without the constraints of projects like Create React App.

This is a starter project that provides an example of how to use Next.js with Express, SASS/SCSS, Bootstrap, Reactstrap (Boostrap 4 for React), the Ionicons icon set, examples of how to include data from remote REST APIs and incorporate an authentication system that supports both oAuth and Email using Passport (a popular authentication framework for Node.js).

This project exists to make it easier to get started a creating production app in React. You are invited to use it as a reference or to copy it and use it as a base for your own projects. Contributions to improve this project are welcome.
